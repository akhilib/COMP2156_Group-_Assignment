DevOps, short for Development and Operations, is a culture, set of practices, 
and approach aimed at improving collaboration and 
communication between software development and IT operations teams. 
A DevOps course typically covers various aspects of this culture, 
including tools, methodologies, and best practices to enable organizations to deliver 
high-quality software at a faster pace.
