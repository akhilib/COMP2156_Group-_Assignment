DevOps, short for Development and Operations, is a culture, set of practices, 
and approach aimed at improving collaboration and 
communication between software development and IT operations teams. 
A DevOps course typically covers various aspects of this culture, 
including tools, methodologies, and best practices to enable organizations to deliver 
high-quality software at a faster pace.

In a DevOps course, students often learn about:

Core Principles: Understanding the fundamental principles of DevOps, such as automation, continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and infrastructure as code (IaC).

Collaborative Tools: Learning about the tools and technologies used in DevOps environments, such as version control systems (e.g., Git), configuration management tools (e.g., Puppet, Ansible), containerization (e.g., Docker), and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes).
